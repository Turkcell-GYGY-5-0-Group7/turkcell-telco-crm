## 2026-06-23 - propagate ADR changes down to subtasks, not just summaries
- Mistake: after changing ADR-006 (Mongo/MinIO), ADR-011 (Keycloak issues tokens), and adding ADR-022,
  only sprint READMEs and contracts were updated; granular subtask files (Sprint 04/05 auth, Sprint 12
  notification) still described the superseded design, so sprints contradicted themselves.
- Rule: when an ADR decision changes, grep the whole `docs/tasks` tree for the old assumption and
  update every affected subtask file, deliverable, test, and dependency - not just the README. A
  README that says X while its subtasks say not-X is worse than no note. Use the tech-lead agent to
  ratify cross-cutting changes (e.g. ARC-06 REST vs gRPC) and amend the cited ADR, not only the
  requirement.

## 2026-06-22 - docs/tasks is the single status source of truth
- Mistake: status lived in two unreconciled places (.claude/roadmap vs docs/tasks).
- Rule: `docs/tasks/` is authoritative for delivery status and program structure (epics/phases live
  in `docs/tasks/STATUS.md`). Update the owning sprint README and `STATUS.md` together. The separate
  `.claude/roadmap` tracker was removed to eliminate the dual-source-of-truth complexity.
